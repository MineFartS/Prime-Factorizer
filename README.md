Prime Factorizer

<hr>

<h3>
Overview:
</h3>

<h4>
I created this is an algoritm to more efficiently calculate the two prime numbers from any semiprime number, aka Prime Factorization.
</h4>

<h4>
Prime Factorization is a science used at the heart of many things like data encryption, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc.
</h4>

<h4>
My overall goal with this algorithm is to improve the efficiency of such methods so that people can still hack or mine crypto, even if they can't afford a fancy setup.

<h3>
Features:
</h3>

- Finding Primes
    - Rules out obvious numbers, such as numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8.
- Prime Factorization
    - It caches all attempts in a json file, and scans the cache before guessing
    - Shuffles all potential primes to improve the speed of calculating larger semiprimes
